# Inkling

Hey! Welcome to Inkling.

This is a social platform I'm building to help people connect in more interesting ways. It's not just another swiping app - I've got some cool features like "Blind Date" and "Dark Desire" (sounds mysterious, right?) alongside the usual feed and chat stuff.

## What's Inside?

I'm currently working on:
- **Feed**: Share thoughts, comments, and stay updated.
- **Matching**: Find people you vibe with.
- **Blind Date**: A way to meet people without the initial bias.
- **Chat**: Real-time messaging with icebreakers to get the conversation flowing.
- **Profile Management**: Customizing your identity on the platform.

## Tech Stack

I built this using some of my favorite tools:
- **Frontend**: React (with TypeScript because types are life), Vite for that fast build speed.
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for the components.
- **Backend**: Supabase for the database and auth.

## Getting Started

If you want to run this locally, it's pretty standard:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Fire up the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Contributing

It's just me working on this for now, but if you see something broken or have a cool idea, feel free to open an issue or PR!
